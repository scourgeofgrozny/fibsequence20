#### 7/30/22:
Some minor changes:
- Added user input filtering; now throws ValueError if input is not type int.
- Implented f-string formatting as well in order to make code cleaner. 
- Improved formatting. Finally installed autopep8 due to someone's recommendation, and it's been a godsend so far in VSC. 

Currently working on a way to make this file independent from sequence.py in that this file will import the math module and calculate Fibanocci numbers using the perfect square property.
Like this, not only will there be one file less, but the digit range of the user input will be theoretically limitless, which in turn will significantly increase the functionality of this project. Shoutout to someone on Discord who suggested the idea; they are the reason this project has been revitalized.
