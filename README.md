# fibanoccisequence_20digit
Back with dumb project; tells you if input number is part of the Fibanocci sequence between 1 and 10^20. Will eventually update with new features once I learn more in Python; been thinking about how cool it would be if I could implement Fibanocci sequence calculated to infinity in order to accept ANY number as input.
